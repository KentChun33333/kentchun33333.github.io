To set ssh-key is more intuitive on linux rather then in windows. You just need to manuel check some configs if it goes as expected.

## Step 1: Check SSH config 

Need to check add `.config` into the `.ssh` folder after using ssh-keygen 
```
Host bitbucket.org
    User git
    Hostname bitbucket.org
    PreferredAuthentications publickey
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/{id_rsa}
```

Make sure `.config` in the `.git` folder is as following 

## Step 2: Git config

Need to check the config 
```
[remote "bitbucket"]
url = git@bitbucket.org:{acc}/{repo}.git
fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/bitbucket/*
```
## Step 3: Adding the public key to the repo 

This one is surprisingly tricky in bitbucket. It is actually funny that there are 3 entry points of adding public SSH key into your repo. You need to go personal setting to add key otherwise it will fail while pushing the code. 
And ... if you are adding the key by repo-setting or project-setting, I am talking about you.
