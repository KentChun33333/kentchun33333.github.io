<li>sampling method is important , ex using machine learning model to have sensitivity guide on how do we fix/sampling the data</li>
<li>Theory drive (Option)</li>
<li>Multivariate testing is great because it shows you the positive or negative impact of every single change, and every single combination of every change, resulting in the most ideal combination (in this theoretical example: A + B + D). However, this strategy is kind of impossible in the real world. Even if you have a ton of traffic, it would still take more time than most marketers have for a test with 15 variations to reach any kind of <a href="https://www.optimizely.com/optimization-glossary/statistical-significance/">statistical significance</a>.</li>
<li>Fractional Factorial Design</li>
