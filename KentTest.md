# Data Science Manager (Singapore based) Agoda

Drive the growth of your team and build a diverse, entrepreneurial team. You are a developer of people. You love leading diverse teams of professionals with both qualitative and quantitative backgrounds using data-driven and insights-led approaches to respond quickly in a dynamic, competitive, and fast changing industry. 

Get your hands dirty. Tackle complex problems in the online travel and ecommerce space using a range of ML and data analysis methods. 

Use our huge data repositories to **push our business metrics** to their bounds, directly and indirectly. 

**Foster a culture** that constantly raises the bar for us and others and supports the freedom to explore and innovate. Work on tough problems. 

- Can we detect causation between metrics and bookings? 
- How can automatically answer our users’ questions -and then do it just as well in all popular languages? 
- How do we find same / similar properties from millions in the inventory based on text and images? 
  - NLP problems --> sentence embedding / classifications --> persona/data-na
  - CV problems -->  
- How do we tune our AB testing platform to ensure we aren’t optimizing noise? 
  - Data clean, advanced outlier filtering, concept drifting ? --> Need to check
  - T-test, most of 
    - key is understand the others contributions
    - Uncontrolled and Unseen Variables (we do randomly)
    - Seen Variable with High sensitivity should be well controlled
  - sampling method is important , ex using machine learning model to have sensitivity guide on how do we fix/sampling the data 
  - Theory drive (Option)
  - Multivariate testing is great because it shows you the positive or negative impact of every single change, and every single combination of every change, resulting in the most ideal combination (in this theoretical example: A + B + D). However, this strategy is kind of impossible in the real world. Even if you have a ton of traffic, it would still take more time than most marketers have for a test with 15 variations to reach any kind of [statistical significance](https://www.optimizely.com/optimization-glossary/statistical-significance/).
  - Fractional Factorial Design
- How do we measure experiment success to properly trade off type I and II errors? 
  - The weighted factor between type1 and type2 should be link to business Metric if possible.
- What is the ideal caching strategy for prices and how do build an ML model to implement it? 
- How can you detect anomalies within more than one million time-series that we track daily? Can you separate between bots and human traffic? Can you make our across-data-centers replication into smart replication using ML models? These are just a few of the diverse questions we tackle and some which you will lead your team to crack. You will be impacting every aspect of the business and it will require various techniques, from diving deep into data with SQL and Big Data tools, all the way to deploying modern machine learning models. Deliver results. Work directly with the heads of the business departments and the product management team. Influence them with compelling product ideas based on data insights that can move the dial on our business.
